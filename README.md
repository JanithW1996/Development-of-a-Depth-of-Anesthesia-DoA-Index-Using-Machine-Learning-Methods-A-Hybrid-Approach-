# Abstract

Depth of anaesthesia is one of the important parameters that vary depending on the type of surgery to ascertain patient safety and optimization of drugs administration. This project intends to formulate a new Depth of Anaesthesia index (DOA index), utilizing machine learning techniques to uplift the accuracy and predictability compared to the currently used indices. This project is specifically focused on Random Forest and Linear Regression methods for the feature selection and model building purposes. Here the feature selection is done using Random Forest whereas for model building, both Random Forest and Linear Regression methods have been employed. A hybrid model is built as the final predictive model for DOA index. The formulated index is evaluated by metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and Pearson correlation. The results achieved from this study suggest that the formulated model for the new index show a strong predictability with significantly correlated predicted and actual values compared to the models formulated in previous two studies (report 1 and report 2). This is because the modelâ€™s got the characteristics of both Random Forest and Linear Regression. Furthermore, the results emphasizes that this model shows a significant improvement compared to BIS index by means of its accuracy, consistency and predictability, offering a valuable predictive index for the detection of Depth of Anaesthesia levels of patients.
